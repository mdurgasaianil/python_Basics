    "### 2. \n",
    "String is a collection of alphabets, words or other characters. And where as Variables are symbols that you can use to store data in a program. So Strings are data that we can use to fill up a variable.\n",
    "### 3. \n",
    "* Integer DataType:\n",
    "integers are represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal).\n",
    "\n",
    "ex: 1,2,3 (int)\n",
    "* String DataType:\n",
    "String is a collection of alphabets, words or other characters. where alphabets, words or other characters are represented by str class\n",
    "\n",
    "ex: \"Anil\" (str)\n",
    "* Float DataType:\n",
    "The FLOAT data type stores double-precision floating-point numbers with up to 17 significant digits.\n",

    "An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value. An expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators. So that if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Expressions:\n",
    "* Constant Expressions: These are the expressions that have constant values only.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 15 + 1.3\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Arithmetic Expressions: An arithmetic expression is a combination of numeric values, operators, and sometimes parenthesis. The result of this type of expression is also a numeric value.\n",

    "| % | a%b | Remainder |\n",
    "| ** | a**b | Exponentiation |\n",

    "c = a / b\n",
    "print(c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Relational Expressions: In these types of expressions, arithmetic expressions are written on both sides of relational operator (> , < , >= , <=). Those arithmetic expressions are evaluated first, and then compared as per relational operator and produce a boolean output in the end. These expressions are also called Boolean expressions.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 21\n",
    "b = 13\n",

    "* Logical Expressions: These are kinds of expressions that result in either True or False.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "P = (10 == 9)\n",
    "Q = (7 > 5)\n",
    "# Logical Expressions\n",
